# Book-of-Cheats
 In this document, I have built out a "Book of Cheats" that covers core IT concepts, Blue Team and Incident Response methods, and additional sheets that might help you. Feel free to share it and use it to fit your needs. Enjoy. - Dave  DISCLAIMER: I only compiled this list of cheat sheets from other sources. As such, you will find references to many different individuals or organizations that created these cheat sheets. I take no credit for any of their creations save for one or two that I did create. As such, the Book of Cheats is completely free and open for use for anyone to have or edit. I merely brought them all together into one source.
